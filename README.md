# 🧮 Counter App

This is a simple **JavaScript counter project** and also my very first step into JavaScript.  
It includes three main functions:  
- ➕ **Increase** the count  
- ➖ **Decrease** the count  
- 🔄 **Reset** the counter back to zero  

## 🚀 Features
- Clean and minimal UI  
- Interactive buttons with instant updates  
- Beginner-friendly JavaScript code  

## 💡 Motivation
This was my **first JavaScript project**, where I learned how to:  
- Use DOM manipulation  
- Handle button click events  
- Update values dynamically on a webpage
